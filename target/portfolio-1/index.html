      <p>Hi there! My name is Ishani. I'm a rising junior studying Computer Science with a minor in Machine
        Learning at
        <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I live
        in Cupertino, CA but I'm originally from Pune, India. </p>
      <p>At CMU, I have taken a wide variety of courses on topics such as Theoretical Computer Science, Data
        Structures
        and Algorithms, Computer Systems, Type Theory and Probability and Statistics.
        I have served as a research assistant on a project to built a session-type based smart contract
        programming
        language. I tutored students weekly in Discrete Math and 3D-Calculus as an
        <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/excel.html">EXCEL Leader</a>. In the past, I
        interned at
        IBM Research on the Cloud Resource Management Team. Currently, I am a STEP Intern at Google.

      <p>In my free time, I like reading fantasy novels, cooking and playing games. I love listening to music,
        especially Hindi music. Recently, I got into Bollywood Dance and I'm working on getting better at
        it.
        My dad is a software engineer at SAP while my mom is a part-time teacher. My older sister Shibani is
        a PhD
        student at MIT. Click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> to see photos of my life!</p>
